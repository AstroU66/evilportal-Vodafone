# evilportals

A repository for the portals i make for the Wifi Pineapples evilportal module

## Installation

Copy the entire `Vodafone` folder (including the `.enable` file) into `/root/portals/` on your WiFi Pineapple. If you are using the SD card, copy it into `/sd/portals/` instead. Once the directory contains an executable `.enable` file, the EvilPortal module will detect and list the portal automatically.

All assets referenced by `index.php` reside in this folder:

- `style.css`
- `tabs.js`
- `ping.js`
- `assets/vodafone-logo.png` *(add your own logo image)*

The credentials will be stored in `creds.txt` inside the same directory.
